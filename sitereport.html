            <h2>Development Experience</h2>
            <p>Building this portfolio website has been an enlightening journey through web development fundamentals. Initially, I struggled with responsive design implementation, particularly getting the navigation menu to work seamlessly across devices. After several iterations, I implemented a mobile-first approach using CSS media queries which solved most layout issues.</p>
            
            <p>The debugging process taught me valuable Chrome DevTools techniques. One memorable challenge was fixing navbar toggle issues in my portfolio. Through trial and error, I learned proper positioning context. Version control with Git was another learning curve - I initially forgot to commit regularly but eventually developed a habit of atomic commits after losing some work.</p>
            
            <p>Designing the contact form presented both UI and functional challenges. It served as a good introduction to form handling. The most rewarding moment was seeing all pages validate successfully after numerous syntax corrections.</p>

            <h2>Module Reflection</h2>
            <p>This module transformed my understanding of client-side development. The hands-on approach helped cement HTML5 semantic structure and CSS layout concepts that I previously only understood theoretically. Learning to implement responsive design principles has been particularly valuable for modern web development.</p>
            
            <p>The progressive nature of the assignments allowed me to build skills incrementally. While challenging at times, debugging my own code significantly improved my problem-solving abilities. The emphasis on validation taught me the importance of standards-compliant code.</p>

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>I adopted a minimalist design approach inspired by <a href="https://dribbble.com" target="_blank">Dribbble portfolio designs</a> and <a href="https://awwwards.com" target="_blank">Awwwards</a>. The color scheme (#333, #3498db) was chosen for professionalism and accessibility, tested with contrast checker.</p>
            
            <p>For typography, I selected system fonts (Arial, sans-serif) for optimal performance while maintaining readability. The layout uses CSS Grid for the projects section and Flexbox for other components, creating visual consistency across pages. Hover effects were added sparingly to enhance user experience without distracting from content.</p>
